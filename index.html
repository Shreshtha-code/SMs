            My Favorite Book Series are The Famous Five. I find the characters to be well written, and the surroundings are so well written that I can picture the surroundings myself. It was also the first novel I read by myself, and I foud the story to be enchanting, and interesting. I like mysteries and adventures and have great fun solving them besides the characters. There is Julian Kirrin, who is twelve in the beginning of the series, and he is the impromptu leader of the group. There is Dick, his brother, eleven and is a joker. There is Georgina Kirrin, who likes to be called George, and doesn't answer to anything else. She is headstrong, with short hair, and has a dog named Timothy. There is Anne, the boys' younger sister, and she is the most domestic of them all. She is timid, but can become quite a tiger when she wants to. <br><br>
            I like the books very much, and I wish to write as enrathling stories.
